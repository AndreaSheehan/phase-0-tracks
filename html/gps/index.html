<!-- 
 I liked this challenge.   I had not pair sign up with me so after the guide left I tried to make it as meaningful as possible.  I have a few warnings left that I was okay with for my level of understandig b/c it is all one huge rabbithole with answered questions unearthing more questions to answer.

Html5 semantic tags lend more meaning to the structure of the page.  In turn this makes it more valuable for screen readers and accessibility.

The rendering engine starts getting teh contents at the networking level, so parsing the HTML and nodes to construct  the DOM (Document Object Model) whch has an almost one to one relation with the markup and the parsing algorithm is part of the HTML5 spec to result in a atree construction stage and a document object output. It is not top down or bottom up.  IT is not one to one in that visual DOM elements will not be inserted into the render tree. THhere is also a difference if there is a style in the html doc- which will pause parsing for retrieval vs a separate CSS sheet which (mostly will not) I need to read up more on all of this as it seems rendering process is not a simple answer!

Sublime snippets are awesome efficienty tools.  And the ability to craft your own custom layouts and shortcuts is powerful.  I want to do this more often to understand how to easily do it from memory, and also to spend more time looking into hwat has arleady been created.

The most challenging part was understanding how the structural tags relate to one another.  How they nest and which are repeatable (article) vs one time (main)  Also how to choose the appropriate semantic section for each purpose and validate that I am using the right one. I also needed a refresher on my tables when I thought about constructng those. -->
