# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* 
* Version control keeps track of changes to a master file 
* or set of files so that they can be recaptured at any point in time.  
* It allows for more than one user to be making 
* changes at the same time or different times.    


* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* 
* A branch is a way of describing the different tracks for 
* versioning.  Your master branch is your pure source branch 
* and you don't want to mess around with it.  So you create
* branches from it to create new clean tracks for working on
* the file. Like multiple versions of you going out and living
* different lives. The process of branching also helps to 
* create time stamps and comments that will document the history 
* of the file.
* Once a branch or multiple branches are created you access 
* the same file name contained on the master from the branch, 
* but it is like a mirror image, and the file is associated 
* only with the branch that opened the file and the changes 
* will NOT affect the master or any other branch. 
* 
* However once you complete your changes, or they have 
* been approved, you add or stage the branch and commit it 
* tp make it ready to merge back into the master. 
* After merging, all merged changes appear in the master. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* the commit records your changes to the repository
* and makes your changes permanent.  THey are ready to 
* be merged.  
*  
* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict happens when you try to integrate the 
* branch versions back to the master.  If you work on a file
* and segment out sections to be addressed in different branches
* a merge conflict would be less likely.  However if three 
* people were say, editing the same exact speech, they might
* for example all change the same parts.  Then at merge  
* the files cannot be reconciled because it cannot
* be determined which changes to incorporate.  A merge conflict
* must be resolved.
