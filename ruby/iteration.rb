#Release 0: Explore Blocks
# write a method that takes a block
# your method should print a status message before & after running the block
# array.each {|item| block} â†’ array


# Method allows input of multiple names and 
# block allows it to print to a list.

# Tried to figure out capitalizing the array, and played with use of 
# #.split and #.map  would like to figure that part out. 




#Release 1: Use each, map, and map!
#Do the thing:
#1. declare an array and a hash, and populate them with data
#2. demonstrate iterating through each using .each, and then using .map! (modify data)
#   note: can't call .map! on a hash
#   Print the data structures before and after each call to demonstrate modification

#Release 2: Use Documentation
#Do the thing:
#Use the documenttion to find other Array and Hash methods that take blocks
#add sample calls -- one for the array and one for the hash
#1. iterates through the times, deleting any that meet a certain condition
#2. filters a data structure for only items that DO satisfy a certain condition
#3. filters a data structure for ONLY items satisfying a certain condition
#4. remove items from a data structure until the condion of the block evaluates false, then stops
