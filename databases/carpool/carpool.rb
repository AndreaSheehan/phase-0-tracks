#make a program to 
#accept input of children's names, age, parent contact info (name and number)
#the above will go into a sql table of childrens names
#accept input for activities that children attend (name of activity and address)
#the above will be captured in an acitivities table
#accept input of carpool drivers:  driver name, foreign id to link to children's table. foreign id to link to acitivities table. 
#driver will actually be a parent of a child in the childrens table so the id of parent will match as a field 
#from id of child. (hmmm. poss need to consider parent table...  but i think this will work)
# challenge:  if time consider adding times to the table so that availability matches can be 
# set to pair a parent with a possible time to drive.  this will make this program 
# actually useful,
